Python Implementation of Ciphers used in Cryptography.
All the programs take in inputs from the command line.

For Traditional Ciphers, plain text space consists of alphanumeric characters, which has following numeric values 
Plain Text =>	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	space	 a  	b 	c	  d	  e	  f	  g	  h
Value      =>	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	   11	  12	13	14	15	16	17	18

i	  j	  k	  l	  m	  n	  o	  p	  q	  r	  s	  t	  u	  v	  w	  x	  y	  z
19	20	21	22	23	24	25	26	27	28	29	30	31	32	33	34	35	36
